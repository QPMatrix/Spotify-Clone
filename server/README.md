<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this branch, I've used the NestJS CLI to generate the <code>songs</code> module for the Spotify Clone backend. This module is crucial for managing the songs within the application, including their creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.</p>

<h3>Creating the Songs Module</h3>
<p>The following command was used to generate the <code>songs</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>nest g module songs</code></pre>

<p>This command created the <code>songs</code> module with all necessary files and structure.</p>

<h3>Creating the Songs Controller</h3>
<p>The following command was used to generate the <code>songs</code> controller:</p>

<pre><code>nest g controller songs</code></pre>

<p>This command created the <code>songs</code> controller, which will handle all incoming requests related to song operations.</p>

<h3>Creating the Songs Service</h3>
<p>The following command was used to generate the <code>songs</code> service:</p>

<pre><code>nest g service songs</code></pre>

<p>This command created the <code>songs</code> service, which will contain the business logic for managing songs in the system.</p>

<h3>Songs Module Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>songs</code> Module: Manages all song-related operations, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting songs in the system.</li>
  <li><code>songs</code> Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests for song-related operations and routes them to the appropriate service methods.</li>
  <li><code>songs</code> Service: Contains the core business logic for processing song-related data and interacting with the database.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>With the <code>songs</code> module, controller, and service in place, the next steps will involve implementing the business logic, setting up routes, and integrating this module with other parts of the backend system.</p>
